# TODO

- Either polling or web sockets to dynamically updates result pages.
- Add standard deviation next to average.
- Move links away from the absolute bottom of the page. People risk touching
- the back button of the browser on a mobile device.
- Make it easier to distribute an invitation to vote. Should be a URL that's
  always the same plus a (4 digit) number that's entered on the page.
- Protect from voting in other people's poll. There should be a key that's
  generated when the poll is created and that's needed in the URL (or as a
  parameter) when voting.
- Make it easier to create a copy of a poll with votes at zero.
