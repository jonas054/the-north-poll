# The North Poll

The North Poll is an online voting app designed for teams that want to
vote on issues quickly and without hassle.

The original use case was [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR)
confidence levels.

## Features

##### A number of preset scales to choose from

By _scale_, we mean the choices available in a vote, for examples the
numbers 1 through 10, the Fibonacci series used for
[planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker), or the
thumbs up, thumbs down, and shrugging icons.

##### Custom scales

It's also possible to define your own scale for a single or series of
poll. Just give them on the creation page with space or semi-colon
between each item.

##### Series of polls

In a series of polls the choices are the same for each poll. A combined result
is presented at the end.

##### Live editing of poll titles

The creator of a poll is directed to a page with links after the poll is
created. One link goes to the poll and includes editing priviledges, another
link goes to the same page but without priviledges. The second link is for
distribution to participants.

##### Calculation of averages and standard deviation

When all choices are numeric, average and standard deviation is presented on
the result pages.
